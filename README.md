# Sarcasm-detector-using-NLP.
Analyzes sentences and detects sarcasm 

Overview
Sarcasm detection is a challenging task in natural language processing (NLP) where the goal is to determine whether a given text is sarcastic or not. Sarcasm is often subtle and can be difficult for even humans to detect, making it a fascinating problem for machine learning. This project aims to build a sarcasm detector using deep learning techniques with the Keras library.

Project Structure
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Dataset: The dataset used for this project typically contains labeled text data where each text is tagged as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
Text Preprocessing: This involves cleaning the text data, including removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, tokenization, and padding sequences to ensure consistent input sizes.
Model Development:

The model is built using Keras, a powerful and easy-to-use deep learning library in Python.
Embedding Layer: Converts the input text into dense vectors of fixed size, which are then fed into the neural network.
LSTM Layer: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer is used to capture dependencies in the sequence of words.
Dense Layer: Fully connected layers are used for final classification, ending with a sigmoid activation function to output a probability score.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The model is trained using a binary cross-entropy loss function, which is suitable for binary classification problems.
Metrics: Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Training and validation accuracy and loss curves are plotted to analyze the model's performance.
Prediction:

Once trained, the model can predict whether new, unseen text is sarcastic or non-sarcastic.
